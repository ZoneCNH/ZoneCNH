# module/binance

`module/binance` is the Binance-specific Market Data C/S Module for ZoneCNH.

It is split into two submodules:

```text
module/binance/client
module/binance/server
```

## Role

`module/binance` owns Binance-specific market_data ingestion into ZoneCNH.

It does not define the canonical market domain itself. Canonical semantics are owned by `module/domain_market`.

It does not define transport-neutral wire/domain contracts itself. Runtime transport is `natsx`; canonical payload semantics are owned by `module/domain_market`.

It owns Binance-specific persistence, query API, and fanout needed to serve accepted Binance facts. It does not own generic cross-exchange market_data semantics or strategy behavior.

## Submodules

| Submodule | Role |
|---|---|
| `module/binance/client` | Connects to Binance, parses exchange-native data, maps to `domain_market` envelopes, publishes through `natsx` JetStream |
| `module/binance/server` | Consumes `natsx` JetStream events, validates and deduplicates facts, persists Binance data, exposes Gin REST APIs, and fans out through `kafkax` |

## Removed Legacy Module

`binance-market` is removed.

New Binance market_data ingestion work must not target:

```text
module/binance-market
github.com/ZoneCNH/binance-market
```

## Runtime Shape

Recommended runtime repository shape:

```text
github.com/ZoneCNH/binance/
  cmd/
    binance-client/
    binance-server/
  internal/
    client/
    server/
  pkg/
    config/
    observability/
```
